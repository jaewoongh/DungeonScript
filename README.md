I currently stopped updating this project.  
I don't think I can work on this project any time soon :(

DungeonScript
=============
version 0.0.11 (May 2014)

Overview
--------
DungeonScript is a language for making html5 retro first person dungeon crawler game, like Wizardry.  
The project is inspired by [Stephen Lavelle](http://www.increpare.com/)'s [PuzzleScript](http://puzzlescript.net), and [Twelve](https://github.com/nasser/twelve) by [Ramsey Nasser](http://nas.sr).

This project was started from the spring 2014 class 'Governing Dynamics of Software' taught by [Ramsey](http://nas.sr) at ITP, Tisch School of the Arts, NYU.

Design Concerns
---------------
* It need to be easier and more intuitive than just javascript.
* But at the same time it should not look way too exotic.
* Avoid to be too easy that restricts variety of game mechanic possibilities
* But it now kinda look too much generic, maybe?

Capabilities, Documentation, and Examples
-----------------------------------------
* Look for [DungeonScript](http://dungeonscript.herokuapp.com) site for more information
* Documentation would not be up to date, but would show some core ideas

Development
-----------
* May 12 (0.0.11) -- Rewrote parser to support flexible charmings and maths
* May 11 (0.0.10) -- Version numbering finally has been started


Contains PEGjs, sugarjs, jquery, and bootstrap.
