DungeonScript
=============
version NOTHING.DONE.YET

Overview
--------
DungeonScript is a language for making html5 retro first person dungeon crawler game, like Wizardry.  
The project is inspired by [Stephen Lavelle](http://www.increpare.com/)'s [PuzzleScript](http://puzzlescript.net), and [Twelve](https://github.com/nasser/twelve) by [Ramsey](http://nas.sr).

Design Concerns
---------------
* It need to be easier and more intuitive than just javascript.
* But at the same time it should not look way too exotic.
* Entity component system would do a great job.

Development
-----------
Currently, I'm working on the project for the class Governing Dynamics of Software by [Ramsey](http://nas.sr).  
It just got started!

* 04/14/2014: Made my mind to make this!
* 04/16/2014: Decided to make it *very simple* for the first version
